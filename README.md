# Fruit-Classification-using-Feedforward-Neural-Networks-in-PyTorch

This is the deep learning project to classify distinct classes of fruits using Feed-forward Neural Networks in the PyTorch Framework.

The dataset contains 131 different classes of fruits. I have applied feedforward neural networks and have received the final accuracy of 96.71%
